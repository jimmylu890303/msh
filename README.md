# My-baSH ( MSH )
This project simulates the behavior of Bash, but further improvements are still needed. 

## How to run
```shell
$ make
$ ./msh
```

## Planning feature
1. Need to add pipeline feature to handle combined commands.

    For example : 
    ```shell
    $ ls -lav | wc -l
    ```

2. Add an autocomplete feature to msh.c
